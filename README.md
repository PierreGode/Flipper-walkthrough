# Flipper-walkthrough
first thing to do is update the firmware on your flipper.


Before updating the firmware on your Flipper Zero, it is important to insert a microSD card into the device. This is necessary as the Flipper Zero databases are stored on the microSD card. 
No poin to even start your flipper the first time without a microSD card.

For more information on the importance of the microSD card and how it works with the Flipper Zero, please refer to the device's documentation.
