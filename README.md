First thing to do is update the firmware on your flipper.

Before updating the firmware on your Flipper Zero, it is important to insert a microSD card into the device. This is necessary as the Flipper Zero databases are stored on the microSD card. 
No point to even start your flipper the first time without a microSD card.

For more information on the importance of the microSD card and how it works with the Flipper Zero, please refer to the device's documentation.
follow  the flipper [Guide](https://docs.flipperzero.one/basics/first-start)

After you have done that it is time to install the firmware on the flipper, here you need to decide if you just want it vanilla or godmode.
Note that if you plan to use the wifi dev board with the <a href="https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder">Marauder </a> firmare you need to use Godmode
for the Godmode i use the <a href="https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware">unleashed-firmware</a> there are other firmwares, but i will reflect this guide based on my setup
