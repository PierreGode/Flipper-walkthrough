The first step is to update the firmware on your Flipper device.

Before updating the firmware on your Flipper Zero, it is essential to insert a microSD card into the device. This is necessary because the Flipper Zero databases are stored on the microSD card. 
10
It's crucial to have a microSD card inserted before using your Flipper for the first time.

For detailed information regarding the importance of the microSD card and its functionality with the Flipper Zero, please consult the device's documentation.
13
Follow the Flipper [Guide](https://docs.flipperzero.one/basics/first-start)

Once you have completed the previous step, it's time to install the firmware on the Flipper. At this point, you need to decide whether you want to use the vanilla or godmode version.
16
Please note that if you intend to use the Wi-Fi development board with the [Marauder](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder) firmware, you will need to opt for the Godmode.
17
For the Godmode, I personally use the [unleashed-firmware](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware). While there are other firmwares available, this guide will focus on my setup.

Choose either the [Vanilla](https://github.com/PierreGode/Flipper-walkthrough/wiki/Vanilla) or [Godmode](https://github.com/PierreGode/Flipper-walkthrough/wiki/Godmode) version.
