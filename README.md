# Flipper-walkthrough
Before updating the firmware on your Flipper Zero, it is important to insert a microSD card into the device. This is necessary as the Flipper Zero databases are stored on the microSD card.

Without a microSD card, the update procedure may not work correctly, and you may encounter errors during the update process. Therefore, make sure to insert a microSD card into your Flipper Zero before proceeding with the firmware update.

For more information on the importance of the microSD card and how it works with the Flipper Zero, please refer to the device's documentation.
